<div class="narrow">
    <p>This website is the result of a small and exploratory research project which stemmed from a collaboration between <a href="//www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/">King's Digital Lab (KDL) <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a> and the department of <a href="//www.kcl.ac.uk/mathematics">Mathematics <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a> to present the network visualization for the project "Taming the complexity of the law: modelling and visualization of dynamically interacting legal systems".</p>
    <p>It was developed in a short amount of time and only to explore possibilities of visualising neural network applied to law data. As such, the result should be considered a <strong>proof of concept</strong> and not a finished product.</p>
    <p>The website is designed, developed and maintained by KDL. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, this means you should be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts;</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen;</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard;</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software;</li>
            <li>skip to the main content when using a screen reader;</li>
            <li>browse content without any readability issues (contrast complies with the AAA standards);</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).</li>
        </ul>
    <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
    <p><a href="//mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

<h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
    <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
	    <ul>
            <li>the data visualisation section is not accessible by screen readers, screen recognition software and other assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Feedback and contact information</h2>
    <p>If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>email: <a href="mailto:kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk">kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk</a></li>
        </ul>
    <p>We'll consider your request and get back to you in 15 days.</p>

<h2>Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
    <p>We're always looking to improve the accessibility of our websites. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we're not meeting accessibility requirements,contact us using the email listed above.</p>
    <p>Please include as many details as you can, such as a link to every page where the issue is occurring and screenshots or other supporting media, whenever possible.</p>

<h2>Enforcement procedure</h2>
    <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="//www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a>.</p>

<h2>Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
    <p>KDL is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h3>Compliance status</h3>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="//www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

<h2>Non accessible content</h2>
<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.<p>

<h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
<h4>Data visualizations</h4>
<p>The visualization disgrams displayed in the part of <a href="//kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/visualization/">visualization of Housing Act 1980</a>, <a href="//kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/visualization-1981/"> Wildlife Act 1981</a> and <a href="//kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/visualization-1981-network/">Wildlife Act 1981 network</a> are not accessible by screen readers, screen recognition software and other assistive technology. This doesn’t meet success criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard">2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)</a>.</p>

<p>We believe the cost of adding accessible interaction to the existing visualisations now would be a <a href="//www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. As stated in the <a href="/tcl/about/">About</a> section, this is not a finished product, but a proof of concept, therefore not all aspects are refined nor necessary complete. We will make another assessment if more funding becomes available. At present, no extra funding was sought for the project. The website as such should be considered a prototype.</p>


<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
<p>This website was tested on 14 February 2020. The test was carried out by KDL. We tested:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The 'homepage' at <a href="https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/">https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/</a></li>
	    <li>The 'about' page at <a href="https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/about/">https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/about/</a></li>
	    <li>The 'visulization' page at <a href="https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/visualization/">https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/visualization/</a></li>
	    <li>The 'TNA Datathon' page at <a href="https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/">https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/</a></li>
	    <li>The 'Wildlife Act 1981' page at <a href="https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/visualization-1981/">https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/visualization-1981/</a></li>
        <li>The 'Wildlife Act 1981-Network' page at <a href="https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/visualization-1981-network/">https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/tcl/tna/visualization-1981-network/</a></li>
    </ul>

<p>We used <a href="//siteimprove.com/en/core-platform/integrations/browser-extensions/">Siteimprove Accessibility Checker plugin</a> to assess compliance with <a href="//www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG</a> and tested the above pages with built-in assistive technology for people who are blind or have low vision.</p>
<p>This statement was prepared on 19 February 2020. It was last updated on the 1 July 2020. This page is based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">sample template provided by gov.uk <i class="fas fa-external-link" aria-label="external link"></i></a>.</p>
