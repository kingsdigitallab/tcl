  <p>This visualisation applies a new workflow to extract citations from the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/contents">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a> using the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/data.xml">XML CMLC data</a> as input. The node colours indicate types of legislation and their size the number of citations (so the bigger the node the more that document is cited by that document).</p>
